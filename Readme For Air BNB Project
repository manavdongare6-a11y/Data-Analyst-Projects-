This project consists of the Data analysis that I have done on the Data of Air BNB.
It consists of 5 charts.
The first one is the average price per bedroom, which shows what the users are spending on an average per bedroom.
The second is a count of the Listings of bedrooms
The third is the average price per Zipcode
Lastly its a revenue for year chart, which shows the price trend for the given year!
